## License
This repository is (partially) licensed under the [Unlicense](http://unlicense.org/) which means you can use everything in any way you want without any conditions. However, I'm not stopping you in mentioning my name in your modified copy or buying me a drink when we should meet.

I do however have some pieces of code copied from friends. If they have a license that's different from mine, it will be clearly stated and the license can be found in the `legal/` folder.

I signed the (un)license with GPG, so You should be able to verify my signature using `gpg --verify LICENSE.sig LICENSE`.
